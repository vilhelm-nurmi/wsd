          This exercise is meant as a gentle introduction to the git workflow
          used during this course. You will learn how to clone your git project
          to a computer, edit a file, <em>add those edits</em>, commit your changes
          and finally push them to your repository at GitLab. We check the
          exercises/01_tools/hello.html in your GitLab repository and expect to
          see the following changes (editing the file is easiest part of this
          exercise):
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Document hello.html will be valid html5</li>
          <li>Content of the meta element with the name of author will be changed</li>
          <li>Content of em with the id of signature will be changed</li>
          <li>The changed meta and #id will be the same</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Detailed instructions</h2>

    <h3>1. Installing git</h3>
    <p>
      In addition to the remote version repository that was created in the last exercise,
      you need the git program to control your local version repository and
      push into and pull from the remote.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many modern Linux systems have git installed by default.
      This is the case for example in the Aalto computer labs.
      You can search for "terminal" program
      in your system and test your installation by typing <kbd>git</kbd>.
      If you do not have git already installed on your computer, where you
      intend to work, you can download git for various platforms from the
      official site: <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a>.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-danger">
      <strong>On Windows</strong>, the rest of the course instructions expect you are using
      <strong>Git Bash</strong> -terminal from the git installation instead of the
      default Windows command prompt.
      On high resolution screens you probably want to make the Git Bash font
      bigger. Click at the top left corner to open the window menu.
      Adjust font size in properties.
    </p>
    <p class="alert alert-info">
      <strong>On OS X</strong>, calling <kbd>git</kbd> in terminal
      may present a dialog to install command line developer tools.
      This is a good option and will play well with any Apple tools in future.
      If you want the latest Git version you can
      download installation package from git-scm.com.
      However, Os X will refuse to install it when clicking.
      You can install the package from unidentified developer via holding ctrl-key
      and clicking package to select "Open" in context menu.

    <p class="alert alert-warning">
      Many IDE or versioning programs can support git and you may use them on this
      course without support. We encourage you to learn git using command line
      which you can use in all environments and over remote connections. General
      help using a bash type command line can be found for example here
      <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/" target="_blank">http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/</a>
      and you can receive help at the exercise sessions.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Generate and set SSH key</h3>
    <p>
      To enable cloning your project to your local computer you need to add an
      SSH key to your GitLab profile. The following commands typed in to a
      terminal will create a new key pair and display the public key.
      (If you already have a key you are using somewhere else, you can use the
      existing one.)
    </p>
    <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>ssh-keygen -t rsa</strong>
# ... you will receive a series of questions ...
# Type <strong>[ENTER]</strong> to accept each default, really no changes unless you know why.
$ <strong>cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub</strong>
# ... the public key encoded as characters prints out ...
# In Git Bash use window menu: edit &gt; mark to copy the key to clipboard.</pre>
    <p>
      The public key is entered to your <a href="https://version.aalto.fi/gitlab/profile/keys" target="_blank">GitLab profile</a>
      via "Add an SSH Key". The title is only for your own information.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Cloning a project</h3>
    <p>
      Now you are ready to clone your project on your local machine.
      You can copy your repository SSH address from the top of
      your repository home page. Choose a directory and type:
    </p>
    <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>git clone git@version.aalto.fi:YOUR_USER_NAME/wsd2018.git</strong>

Cloning into 'wsd2018'...
remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Receiving objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
...</pre>
    <p>
      This will authenticate you on the server with the SSH key you created in the
      previous step and create a folder with the name of <code>wsd2018</code> where the
      contents of your repository from your server are cloned. If you did not change
      directories in Git Bash look for <code>C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\wsd2018</code>
      on your computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next steps in the instructions change directory to wsd2018. Following
      will also lists the contents of your cloned work space.
    </p>
    <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>cd wsd2018</strong>
$ <strong>ls</strong>
exercises       lectures       readme.md</pre>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
      Note that GitLab also has a feature where you can download
      your project. If you download your project instead of cloning you will not
      be able to submit your exercises.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Solving The Exercise</h3>
    <p>Open up <code>exercises/01_tools/hello.html</code> on your favorite code editor... or if
      you don't have a code editor read
      <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/sitepoint-smackdown-atom-vs-brackets-vs-light-table-vs-sublime-text/" target="_blank">review of editors</a> that are particularly
      well suited for this course. If you have no preferences
      <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank">Atom</a> is a good choice that we can support.
    </p>

    <p>You are free to edit the hello.html file to test things out,
      it just needs to match following four criteria so you get the points
      from this exercise:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Document hello.html will be valid html5</li>
      <li><code>content</code> attribute of the <code>meta</code> element with
        the <code>name</code> attribute <code>author</code> will be changed</li>
      <li>Content of <code>em</code> element with the <code>id</code> attribute
        <code>signature</code> will be changed</li>
      <li>The changed attribute and element content will be the same</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Add, Commit and Push changes</h3>
    <div class="alert alert-danger">
      <strong>On windows</strong>, git will most likely complain about your user
      identity when you try to commit your changes. You should start this step
      by explaining who you are.
      <pre class="terminal">
$ <strong>git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"</strong>
$ <strong>git config --global user.email username@aalto.fi</strong></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      After you've modified the hello.html file, you need to commit your
      modifications. First check the status of the project:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <strong>git status</strong>

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes not staged for commit:
(use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
(use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

modified:   exercises/01_tools/hello.html

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</pre>
    <p>
      To <em>stage</em> files for a commit you first need to <em>add</em> them.
      Note that add does not refer to adding a new file to your project but adding a file to a commit.
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <strong>git add exercises/01_tools/hello.html</strong></pre>
    <p>
      Again you can check with git status that the file will be included in the
      commit:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <strong>git status</strong>

On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.

Changes to be committed:
(use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

modified:   exercises/01_tools/hello.html</pre>
    <p>
      Now you can commit these changes to your repository with <kbd>git commit</kbd>.
      It will open a text editor where you can write
      a message for the commit that reflects the changes that you've done.
      You can also just type the commit message alongside the command with -m switch, for example:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <strong>git commit -m "Solved the first exercise"</strong>
[master ab66b8d] Solved the first exercise
1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletion(-)</pre>
    <p class="alert alert-warning">
      On many bash systems the default editor is <strong>vim</strong>.
      While it is an awesome editor there is a learning curve.
      Hints of the day: <kbd>i</kbd> for insert mode. <kbd>Your message</kbd>
      <kbd>ESC</kbd> to exit insert mode. <kbd>:wq</kbd> write and quit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the commit is done and the changes you've made to the files that
      you committed are tracked in the repository history.
      You can verify this by command <kbd>git log</kbd>.The first entry should look
      something like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <strong>git log</strong>
commit 2b9c171c4f051cd46b5ce3d77141aaef5bfdce9a
Author: Firstname Lastname &lt;YOUR_USER_NAME@version.aalto.fi&gt;
Date:   Sun Oct 12 19:01:29 2018 +0300

Solved the first exercise</pre>
    <p>
      What remains is pushing these changes to your remote repository
      in GitLab server which is known as "origin" of your clone.
      This can be done with <kbd>git push</kbd>:
    </p>
    <pre>
$ <strong>git push origin master</strong>
Counting objects: 7, done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 345 bytes, done.
Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
To git@version.aalto.fi:xxxxxxxx/wsd-material.git
eb2fdc8..ab66b8d  master -&gt; master</pre>
    <p>If there were no errors the changes are now reflected in
      GitLab (you can browse your project's files if you want to verify this).

    <h3>6. Submitting Your Project to A+</h3>

    <p>
      Submitting your solution is similar to the first exercise. Just copy and
      paste your GitLab project's URL to A+.
